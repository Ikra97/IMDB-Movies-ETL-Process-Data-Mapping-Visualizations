IMDB-Data-mapping-ETL-Process-Metadata-Visualizations

Project Overview

This project aims to analyze movie data and build a robust ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) pipeline using Alteryx and Talend. The data is then visualized using Power BI and Tableau to provide insightful dashboards. The project includes data profiling, mapping, modeling, and ETL job design, ensuring that the SQL outputs match the visual values in Power BI/Tableau.



Detailed Steps and Processes

Data Profiling and Analysis using Alteryx

Step 1: Imported movie dataset into Alteryx.

Step 2: Performed data profiling to check for data completeness, consistency, and accuracy.

Step 3: Generated a comprehensive report detailing the profiling results.

Step 4: Drawed inferences and completed data cleaning or transformation steps

Creating the Mapping Document

Step 1: Analyzed the data sources and identified target structures.

Step 2: Documented the mapping of source fields to target fields in the provided Excel template.

Step 3: Ensured all transformations and business rules are clearly outlined.

Data Modeling and Dimension Table Implementation

Step 1: Designed the Movie Titles Dimension table as a Type 2 Slowly Changing Dimension.

Step 2: Implemented the data model ensuring historical data is accurately maintained.

Step 3: Validated the model against the requirements.

Designing ETL Jobs with Talend

Step 1: Set up metadata-based connections to ensure flexibility and reusability.

Step 2: Defined contexts and environments for different stages (development, testing, production).

Step 3: Developed ETL jobs to extract, transform, and load the data as per the mapping document.

Step 4: Tested ETL jobs to ensure data integrity and accuracy.

Creating and Publishing Dashboards

Step 1: Imported the processed data into Power BI and Tableau.

Step 2: Created interactive dashboards to visualize key metrics and insights.

Step 3: Published the dashboards and share access with stakeholders.

SQL Scripts and Output Verification

Step 1: Written SQL scripts to generate the necessary data outputs.

Step 2: Compared SQL outputs with the visual values in Power BI/Tableau to ensure consistency.

Step 3: Documented the SQL scripts and verification results.

Conclusion

This project demonstrated a comprehensive approach to data analysis, ETL pipeline development, and data visualization. By following the detailed steps and utilizing the specified tools, the project ensures high-quality data processing and insightful visualizations.
